## How I worked on this project

My goal was to simulate a professional working environment üë©üèª‚Äçüíª.

I based it on a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/proto/IbAF9epoUByHcZ2GpV8QSU?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=IWCweJbHxXzSZ94B-6), trying to comply with the 'pixel perfect' concept.

I separated each requirement into subtasks.

I wrote tidy and reusable code, separated components into folders and followed the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

## What else would I add to this project? üöÄ

In the future I would like to work on the missing pages, creating a design from scratch and integrating them into the site. I would add the function to start section and register, the possibility to buy, etc.
